# etl-sandbox
A small-scale data engineering project designed to simulate real-world ETL operations using a RESTful API and a React frontend.

The system allows authenticated users to upload, preview, and process CSV-based commerce data, store it in a database via stored procedures, and isolate invalid records into a quarantine table.
This project focuses on practicing basic ETL concepts, backend validation, and frontend-backend integration using Django REST Framework and React.
